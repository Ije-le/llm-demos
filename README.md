### LLM Demos
The site works as is.

I tried to get Gemini to capitalize the names and it worked. I asked her to include last names and put the names in initial capitals, which worked fine too. Then I told her to include a bar chart below the table to visualize the results. The initial chart was too big and it was a struggle trying to get Gemini to find a size that worked. I had to follow up with prompts many times to get the size that worked. But by the time I got the chart size I wanted, I noticed that some of the earlier instructions had been erased. The names had gone back to how they were intially: in small letters.

This can be used to visualize census data to show population of counties in a state.
